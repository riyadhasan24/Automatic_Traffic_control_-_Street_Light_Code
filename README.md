# Smart Traffic Light with Street Light Control

This project uses an Arduino Nano to control a simple traffic light system (Red, Yellow, Green) along with an automatic street light that turns on based on ambient light detected by an LDR sensor.

### 🧩 Components Used:
- Arduino Nano  
- 5V Relay  
- BC547 Transistor  
- 1K & 10K Resistors  
- 1N4007 Diode  
- 4V SMD LED Light  
- Red, Green, Yellow LEDs  
- LDR  
- DC Input Jack  
- 5V Charger  
- 4V Battery  

### 🔧 Function:
- Traffic signals change automatically with proper delay.
- A streetlight turns on when it’s dark using LDR detection.
